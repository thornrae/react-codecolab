### Planning

A 3-hour meeting for our team project was conducted to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and with a general consensus have agreed on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

A public-facing GitHub repo and markdown file was created by team member Taylor to include the following components in our team agreement submission.

### 1. Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. The following is a list of areas of strength, competency and growth for each member of our team.

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

|          | Key Strength                                         | Strength Utilization                                                      | Competency Growth                      |     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --- |
| Taylor   | Styling, being thorough                              | Reviewing progress, making sure all to do items aligns with project goals | Github flow                            |     |
| Terrence | Backend, working with new technologies               | Socket.io, backend namespaces                                             | Ambition in personally-driven projects |     |
| Kale     | CSS/styling                                          | Creating front end user interface                                         | Backend                                |     |
| Clement  | Acting as the Project Manager for this group project | Keeping the SDLC moving through a seamless process                        | Ambition in project management         |     |

- We will take a two pronged approach to the day-to-day workflow:
  - As previously mentioned, we will start our sessions with a stand-up.
  - Secondly, we will be heavily rely upon our Kanban process as laid out in Trello.

### 2. Conflict Plan

- To resolve conflict,we will utilize a majority rule approach. We will be open and honest about issues and concerns. We will discuss all in an open forum as a group, even if it's between two people, and then use a vote/consensus to resolve as a group. We will be able to use Clement (PM) to mediate on potential conflicts objectively.
- If someone is taking over, this would be considered a conflict and so we would need to refer to bullet point 1 and review our work plan.
- To approach members being at different levels of understanding, doing stand ups before coding sessions will be important.

### 3. Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle our project, the following will detail how our group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort but a team effort and to make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Areas of communication concern:

- What hours will the team be available to communicate?
  - Hours will be flexible and respectful of each other's time.
- What platforms will your team use to communicate?
  - Slack for messaging
  - Trello for project management of the SLDC
- How often will you take breaks?
  - When working as a team the group will take breaks every hour adlib. We will meet between 6 - 9 pm pst
  - When working as individuals each person will adhere to a min/max of 2 - 5 hours while taking breaks as needed.
  - When working as individuals each person agrees to not allow themself to be overstressed.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

  - Each person will be open and honest on where they are within the project.
  - If there is ambiguity, be honest, open and ask questions or ask for help.
  - Each pwerson will adhere the 15 minute rule
  - If we recognize we're falling behind as a team we will regroup, restate and reset our priorities and aim for the MVP.
  - If necessary we will reach out to either John or Chris for advice.
  - If our group hit a sticking point we will do the same as previously mentioned.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - We will communicate through Slack but will still be mindful and respectful of the timing.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - We will conduct a group stand-up/check-in at the beginning of each coding session.
  - Before moving on we will be certain to resolve all issues heard.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - The Project Manager will stand-in as the "safe place". Each team member will have the opportunity to have private and anonymous discussion with the PM to voice his/her concerns.
  - The PM will address these concerns with the group as a whole.

### 4. Work Plan

Our plan to assure everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on agreed upon core problems are as follows:

- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will utilize a Kanban methodology within Trello for this purpose
  - The PM will be the admin for this process
- What project management tool will be used?
  - The groups have settled on using Trello

### 5. Git Process

Our team’s Git workflow for coding tasks will be as follows:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - The repo will reside on Github
  - TJ will be the primary person responsible for handling all issues related to PR, gituations, etc.
  - The project workflow will be on Trello
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Our work will be a collaborating effort and each team member will have full access to the repo.
- What is your Git flow?
  - There will be dev branches off the main branch
  - Each person will work on his/her own uniquely identified dev branch
- Will you be using a PR review workflow?
  - Yes. Kale and TJ will be responsible for this process with the PM being notified each time. Each time a PR review is completed it will be documented in Trello.
- How many people must review a PR?
  - Two people will be doing this task
- Who merges PRs?
  - Terrence will be the only person doing this task since he's more versed in troubleshooting gituations.
- How often will you merge?
  - At the end of each mob coding session or adlib when the code works and is not broken
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
  - It will be critical that when a piece of the code works it will be ACP'd and communicated through Slack.
